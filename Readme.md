# Walk Right In
Avoid all obstacles and run to the end of the map to win in this game. There are doors in the game that can either help or hinder your journey. Some doors will teleport you forward in the map while some doors will teleport you backwards. As the game progresses, the map will move faster and faster, so it will become harder and harder to stay alive.

This game is written in Python using Pygame Zero. It's currently a working progress so not everything is complete just yet. To play the game you will need to download this project's folder. You will then need to install Pygame Zero using the command `pip install pgzero`

To run the game, you can either run `game.py` from an IDE or use the command `pgzrun game.py`
